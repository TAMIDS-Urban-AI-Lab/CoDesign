# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to CoDesign! The goal of this app is to encourage community collaboration, so collaborators like you can offer solutions to everyday problems. To ensure consistency, good collaboration, and code quality, please follow these guidelines when contributing to this repository:

## 1. Claim an issue
- Browse available issues on our Github Issues page: https://github.com/TAMIDS-Urban-AI-Lab/CoDesign/issues
- Work with the CoDesign team to select an issue that strikes the right balance between the project's priorities and your skillset.
- Assign the issue to yourself and make sure to update it from time to time!

## 2. Branching Strategy

- Always create a new branch for your work, do not commit your changes directly to the main branch.
- Use a meaningful branch name. The structure we encourage is your username + the feature name.
  Example:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b username/<your-feature-name>
  ```

## 3. Commit Messages

- Use a meaningful commit message for every commit.
- Please review the examples in the article below to understand good versus bad commit messages:

## 4. Creating a Pull Request

Please include the following sections in your Pull Request:
- Summary: Summarize your changes in 1-2 details
- Details: Document what exactly you changes and why. This is where you should expand on complex changes.
- Testing: Include a list of what you tested and a screenshot/video demonstrating that the functionality works.
- Your code must be reviewed by atleast one other reviewer.

## 5. Merging to your code

Ensure that all feedbacks are solved from reviewers before merging your PR.
If any follow-up changes are requested, ALWAYS create a new issue to track the follow-up.

When your PR is ready to merge:
- Select the 'Squash and Merge' dropdown option to squash all commits into one commit.
- Ensure that the final commit message is descriptive.

Congrats! You are now a contributor to CoDesign, helping us become one step closer to encouraging better community collaboration.
